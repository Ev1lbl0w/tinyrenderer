# tinyrenderer

My version of the awesome [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki), written in Dlang.

## What's different?

- Image format uses PPM instead of TGA, as I wanted to have zero external dependencies, and PPM was even easier to write a writer.

## Dependencies

- [dlang](https://dlang.org/)
- [dub](https://code.dlang.org/)

## Compilling

`dub build`

## Running

`dub run`, or `./tinyrenderer` after compilling

## Testing

`dub test`
